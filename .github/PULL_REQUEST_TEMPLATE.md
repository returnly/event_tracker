## Best Practices

In order to achieve a consensus on PRs and improve our workflow, the team has decided to agree on best practices [Check them out!](https://returnly.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2963439664/EngineCare+WebApps+Pull+Request+Best+Practices)

 Here is a list of them:

- Keep the PR as small as possible, dividing it into different PRs if possible
- Commits are descriptive and show information on the ticket journey
- Explain reasons behind changes that might not be obvious or seem complex
